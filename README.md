# The Hidden Risks of Mobile VPNs: A Critical Analysis

Welcome to the repository for our research project on "The Hidden Risks of Mobile VPNs." This study provides a critical analysis of the security and privacy risks associated with the use of mobile Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Our goal is to uncover less-known vulnerabilities and offer insights into how users can safeguard their digital privacy effectively.

## About the Research

In this project, we conducted an in-depth analysis of popular mobile VPN applications to identify potential risks that could compromise user security and privacy. This research is crucial in the era of increasing reliance on mobile devices for both personal and professional use.

### Objectives

- To identify and document the security vulnerabilities present in commonly used mobile VPNs.
- To analyze the impact of these vulnerabilities on user privacy and data security.
- To provide recommendations for users and developers to mitigate identified risks.

## Key Findings

- **Vulnerability Analysis**: Detailed examination of encryption protocols, data leakage, and potential entry points for attackers.
- **Privacy Concerns**: Exploration of how VPNs handle user data, including logging practices that may threaten user privacy.
- **Impact Assessment**: Evaluation of the real-world implications of these vulnerabilities for everyday VPN users.
